   - Real-time communication and scheduling capabilities

2. **Technology-Driven Accessibility**
   - Web-based platform accessible from any device
   - Integrated video conferencing for remote sessions
   - Geolocation-based therapist matching
   - Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access

3. **Comprehensive Management System**
   - Admin portal for system oversight and quality control
   - Automated appointment scheduling and reminder systems
   - Payment processing and commission tracking
   - Analytics and reporting for continuous improvement

### Expected Outcomes
- Increased accessibility to mental health services
- Reduced administrative overhead for therapists
- Improved user experience through modern, intuitive design
- Enhanced system reliability through separate application architecture
- Better data management and analytics for service optimization
