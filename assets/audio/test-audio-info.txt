Audio Files for MindEase App Testing:

Current files in assets/audio/:
- audio-1.wav (Rain sounds) - PRIMARY FILE USED BY ALL MEDITATION SOUNDS

All meditation sounds (Rain, Ocean Waves, Forest, White Noise, Fireplace, Piano)
use the same audio file (audio-1.wav) for consistent functionality and reduced APK size.

If sounds are not playing, ensure:
1. Audio files are valid and not corrupted
2. Files are properly placed in assets/audio/ folder
3. pubspec.yaml includes assets/ directory
4. Device volume is turned up
5. App has audio permissions
