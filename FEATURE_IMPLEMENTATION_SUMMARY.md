## 🔧 **KEY FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Mood Journal API Fix** ✅
**Problem**: Frontend calling `/api/mood/:userId` but backend expecting `/api/mood/:id`
**Solution**: Updated route parameter mapping in `postRoutes.js`
**Result**: Mood journal now fetches data correctly

### 2. **Nearby Therapists Geolocation** ✅
**Problem**: No API for finding therapists by location
**Solution**: 
- Added `/api/therapists/nearby` endpoint with MongoDB geospatial queries
- Enhanced therapist registration to capture real coordinates
- Added proper GeoJSON Point structure with 2dsphere indexing
**Result**: Users can now find therapists within specified radius

### 3. **Enhanced Therapist Registration** ✅
**Problem**: Therapists registered with default [0,0] coordinates
**Solution**:
- Added location service integration to therapist registration
- Added required fields: phone, experience, hourly rate, bio
- Automatic coordinate capture from user's location
**Result**: Therapists now register with proper geolocation data

### 4. **Payment Management in Settings** ✅
**Problem**: No payment management interface in settings
**Solution**:
- Added `PaymentManagementScreen` to settings
- Integrated Stripe card form for payment methods
- Added payment history display
- Created setup intent endpoint for Stripe
**Result**: Users can manage payment methods from settings
